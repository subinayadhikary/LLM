This is a second journey of the appellant to this Court. Earlier the appellant had questioned grant of bail to the respondent no.2 in each case by learned Single Judge of the Orissa High Court. The date for framing of charges was fixed on 6.6.2002. Accused Bimal filed bail application before the High Court. In the result, all the appeals fail and are dismissed accordingly. We do not find any reason why to differ therewith. It was within their special knowledge. We have been taken through the entire evidence on record. Therefore, interference with the judgment of the High Court is warranted. Sometimes it is the correctional needs of the perpetrator that are offered to justify a sentence. Subsequently, FIR No.125/1998 (Ex.P.22) was registered on 22.8.1998 itself. The question whether there was any common intention or not depends upon inference to be drawn from the proved facts and circumstances of each case. Award of punishment following conviction at a trial in a system wedded to the rule of law is the outcome of cool deliberation in the court room after adequate hearing is afforded to the parties, accusations are brought against the accused, the prosecuted is given an opportunity of meeting the accusations by establishing his innocence.
